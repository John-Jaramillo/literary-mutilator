<p id="paragraph1">I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Not if I weaken first. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Computer, lights up! We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I'll be sure to note that in my log. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane.

<p id="paragraph2"> Doctor Gaius Baltar: [after finding out that he's being forced into becoming a politician while testing blood samples] Politics is the only thing more boring than blood samples.
    Number Six: We're the children of humanity. That makes them our parents in a sense.  Aaron Doral: True, but parents have to die. It's the only way children can come into their own.
    Commander William Adama: I gave the order, Son. It was my responsibility.  Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: I pulled the trigger. That's mine.
    Commander William Adama: There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people.
    [repeated line, which a Six copy asks whenever it meets a human for the first time]  Number Six: Are you alive?

    Dr. Rodney McKay: [when the Daedalus becomes infected with a computer virus] Oh, crap!  Hermiod: What did you do?  Dr. Rodney McKay: I ran it through a translation program, the virus is Wraith.  Hermiod: Crap, indeed.
