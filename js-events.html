<p>I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Not if I weaken first. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Computer, lights up! We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I'll be sure to note that in my log. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane.</p>

Aiden Ford, USMC: Earthlings. It's compromising security!  Carson Beckett M. D.: She knows I'm from Earth, son! It's not a bloody secret!
    Dr. Rodney McKay: Maybe we should make a diversion.  Maj. Lorne: Are you volunteering?  Dr. Rodney McKay: I'll shut up.
    [about an adolescent Wraith]  Maj. John Sheppard: So it's a teenage things. Pimples, rebellion, life sucking.  Carson Beckett M. D.: Something like that.
    Dr. Rodney McKay: [when the Daedalus becomes infected with a computer virus] Oh, crap!  Hermiod: What did you do?  Dr. Rodney McKay: I ran it through a translation program, the virus is Wraith.  Hermiod: Crap, indeed.
    Elizabeth Weir, Ph. D.: How much time do you need?  Dr. Rodney McKay: Oh, well...  Dr. Zelenka: ...a week...  Dr. Rodney McKay: ...a couple of hours.  Elizabeth Weir, Ph. D.: I'll take the second estimate. Go.
