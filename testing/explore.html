<p id="paragraph4">I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Captain, why are we out here chasing comets? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Not if I weaken first. The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. Computer, lights up! We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone I'll be sure to note that in my log. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane.
